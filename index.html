            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>Dive into a 2D grid-based world where you control a character navigating through various challenges. The
                game is built on a tile system, each having distinct properties such as solidity, bounce factor,
                friction, and gravity effects. These properties dynamically influence the player's movement, offering a
                unique gameplay experience with each tile interaction.The game provides mechanisms for the player to
                move left, right, and jump. Moreover, the game's view adjusts based on the player's position, ensuring
                you always have the best perspective of the action.Rendered on a canvas, this game blends classic 2D
                gaming with modern design aesthetics. Use the arrow keys to move around and experience the dynamic world
                tailored by varying tile properties.</p>
